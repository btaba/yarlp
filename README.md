Yet Another Reinforcement Learning Package

##### TODO:

* TRPO
    - check kl is correct and all other calculations with known functions in numpy
    - policy agnostic model factories
    - check entropy calc, with scipy
* separate update from agent training code
* DQ, DDQ

* load model from file with args and model weights
* Classic policy and value based methods
* ddpg, dpg, COPDAC-Q
* parallel sampler for rollouts
* handle reshaping of arrays for different action/obs spaces
* black box optimizer on params
